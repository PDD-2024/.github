Principles of programming design/analysis. Concepts in software development. Uses a programming project to illustrate key ideas in program design/development, data structures, debugging, files, I/O, testing, and coding standards.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the course, students should have experience with the following:

- The software engineering process, including a general understanding of large programming projects and their differences from small ones, as well as different software process models, design basics, and testing basics.
- Reasonable C++ programmer proficiency, covering C++ class basics, inheritance, polymorphism, assertions and exception handling, pointers, memory management, and similar advanced topics.
- UML class diagrams and other fundamental diagrams.
- Completion of a large, mult-iteration programming project.
- Familiarity with software development tools such as version control software, debuggers, etc.
- Adoption of good coding practices, including documentation skills, good program organization, use of naming conventions, good class design, etc.
- Writing in computer science, involving items such as project descriptions, code documentation, and progress reports.

## Methodology

The classes of this course will be taught orally, with the help of slides to illustrate and complement the information provided by the teacher. Additionally, classes will include participatory exercises in which students will work with development environments to implement programs on their respective computers.
